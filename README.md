# LAB_EVAL
This project involves analyzing the performance of different machine learning models using a dataset related to fuel cell performance. The evaluation involves selecting a subset of data based on roll numbers, dividing it into training and testing sets, running multiple regression models, and comparing their performance.

The project evaluates the following models:

Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
